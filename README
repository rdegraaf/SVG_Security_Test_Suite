SVG Security Test Suite 
=======================

This project contains a battery of test cases designed to test how browsers 
handle CSS, JavaScript, and external objects loaded from SVG documents.

svg.test
--------

This set of tests loads simple SVGs that load internal CSS and JavaScript, 
same-origin external CSS and JavaScript, different-origin external CSS and 
JavaScript, and other SVG documents.  Each case is loaded eight different ways 
under a variety of different CSP and XFO settings. 

To run the tests, serve the directory `svg.test` from an Apache+PHP web server 
using the configuration given in `svg.test.conf`. Point all of the server 
names and aliases in `svg.test.conf` at the web server, then load 
http://svg.test using the browser that you want to test.  Pick a page from the 
test matrix and compare the actual results against the listed expected results.
